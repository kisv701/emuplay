A neat little Node.js app that lets your phone act as a game pad. Anything that is supported by vJoy is supported here.
There is a c++ program called controller_feeder.exe that acts as an interface between vJoy and the node server. 
This program will be uploaded to a homepage some time soon, when I get around to it =)
